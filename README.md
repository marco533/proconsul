# PROCONSUL Analysis and Comparison
In this repository you will find all the functions and the methods used to analyse the performance of PROCONSUL and compare them with the ones of DIAMOnD (article: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004120, implementation: https://github.com/dinaghiassian/DIAMOnD).

The README is structured in this way: the first section describes in detail what each folder contains, the second section are the prerequisites that you need to install if you want to reproduce this code on your machine and the last is the "how to run" section in which we explain the commands to perform all the different analysis.

Please read the PROCONSUL article if you want to know in detail how PROCONSOUL works (TODO: add link) and the interpreation of the results, or, if you prefer, you can also find a simple implementation of PROCONSUL with test examples here: https://github.com/rickydeluca/PROCONSUL
